# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* The page will reload if you make edits.\
* You will also see any lint errors in the console.
* `yarn test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
* `yarn build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder. 
  * It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
  * The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
  * Your app is ready to be deployed!
* `yarn eject` will remove the single build dependency from your project and will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

# Getting down to the minimum

1. Removed everything except `head/title` and `body/div[id=root]` from `public/index.html`
2. Removed `index.css` and web vitals from `src/index.js`
3. Removed css stuff from `src/App.js` and deleted `src/App.css`

# Adding Counter component
